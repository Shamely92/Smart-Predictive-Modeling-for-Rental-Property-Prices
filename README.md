# Smart-Predictive-Modeling-for-Rental-Property-Prices
**Problem Statement**
In the real estate industry, determining the appropriate rental price for a property is crucial for property owners, tenants, and property management companies. Accurate rent predictions can help landlords set competitive prices, tenants make informed rental decisions, and property management companies optimize their portfolio management.

The goal of this project is to develop a data-driven model that predicts the rental price of residential properties based on relevant features. By analyzing historical rental data and property attributes, the model aims to provide accurate and reliable rent predictions.

**Dataset Description**
The dataset contains the following columns:

id: A unique identifier for each property listing.
type: The type of property, such as BHK1, BHK2, RK1, etc.
locality: The specific neighborhood or area where the property is located.
activation_date: The date when the property listing was activated or made available for rent.
latitude: The geographic latitude coordinate of the property's location.
longitude: The geographic longitude coordinate of the property's location.
... (other columns)
Key Tasks
**Data Preprocessing:**

Clean and preprocess the features and historical rental prices data, handling missing values, outliers, and encoding categorical variables.
Feature Selection and Engineering:

Identify key features that significantly influence rental prices.
Perform feature engineering to create new informative features, such as proximity scores to important facilities.
**Model Selection:**

Choose appropriate regression algorithms for the task, such as linear regression, decision trees, random forests, gradient boosting, or neural networks.
Consider ensembling or stacking multiple models for improved performance.
**Model Training and Evaluation:**

Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
Train the selected models on the training data.
Evaluate model performance using appropriate metrics (e.g., mean squared error, mean absolute error) on the testing data.
**Hyperparameter Tuning:**

Fine-tune model hyperparameters to optimize performance.
**Interpretability and Explainability:**

Analyze feature importance to understand which factors contribute most to the predicted rental prices.
Provide insights into how specific features impact rental prices.
**Deployment:**

Once a satisfactory model is developed, deploy it as a user-friendly web application or API where users can input property details and receive rent predictions.
